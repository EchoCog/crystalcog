# Crystal OpenCog Attention Allocation System

This document describes the attention allocation mechanisms implemented in Crystal for the OpenCog system.

## Overview

The Crystal OpenCog attention allocation system implements Economic Attention Allocation (ECAN), a sophisticated mechanism for managing computational resources by allocating "attention" to the most important atoms in the knowledge graph.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AttentionBank** - Manages STI/LTI funds and attentional focus
2. **AttentionDiffusion** - Spreads attention between related atoms  
3. **RentCollector** - Maintains economic balance through rent collection
4. **AllocationEngine** - Coordinates all attention mechanisms

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Attention Value System
- **STI (Short-Term Importance)**: Dynamic attention values that change rapidly
- **LTI (Long-Term Importance)**: Stable attention values for persistent importance  
- **VLTI (Very Long-Term Importance)**: Ultra-stable importance flags

#### 2. Attention Bank Management
- **Fund Management**: Maintains global STI and LTI funds (target: 10,000 each)
- **Attentional Focus**: Manages top-K most important atoms (configurable, default 1000)
- **Wage Calculation**: Computes attention wages based on available funds

#### 3. Attention Diffusion Algorithms

**Neighbor Diffusion:**
- Spreads attention from high-STI atoms to their neighbors
- Uses tournament selection for diffusion targets
- Respects maximum spread percentage (40% by default)

**Hebbian Diffusion:**
- Transfers attention between co-activated atoms
- Based on connectivity patterns in the knowledge graph
- Implements reinforcement learning principles

#### 4. Economic Rent Collection
- **Basic Rent Collection**: Collects rent from all high-STI atoms
- **Tournament Rent**: Uses tournament selection for fair rent collection
- **Adaptive Rent**: Adjusts rates based on fund levels
- **AF Rent**: Higher rates for attentional focus atoms

#### 5. Goal-Based Attention Boosting
- **Goal Types**: Reasoning (0.9), Learning (0.7), Memory (0.65), Adaptation (0.75), Processing (0.85)
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Goals can be weighted and combined
- **Targeted Boosting**: Identifies and boosts goal-relevant atoms

#### 6. Priority Calculation System
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Combines STI, LTI, VLTI, connectivity, and goal relevance
- **Priority Levels**: Critical (1.5x), High (1.2x), Medium (1.0x), Low (0.8x), Minimal (0.6x)
- **Attentional Focus Boost**: 1.2x multiplier for atoms in focus

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```crystal
# Create atomspace and attention engine
atomspace = AtomSpace::AtomSpace.new
engine = Attention::AllocationEngine.new(atomspace)

# Create some atoms
dog = atomspace.add_concept_node("dog")
mammal = atomspace.add_concept_node("mammal")
link = atomspace.add_inheritance_link(dog, mammal)

# Stimulate atoms
engine.bank.stimulate(dog.handle, 100_i16)
engine.bank.stimulate(link.handle, 80_i16)

# Run attention allocation
results = engine.allocate_attention(3)
```

### Goal-Based Allocation

```crystal
# Set specific goals
goals = {
  Attention::Goal::Reasoning => 1.2,
  Attention::Goal::Learning => 0.9,
  Attention::Goal::Memory => 0.7
}
engine.set_goals(goals)

# Run allocation with goals
results = engine.allocate_attention(5)
```

### Focused Attention

```crystal
# Focus attention on specific atoms
target_atoms = [important_atom.handle, critical_link.handle]
engine.focus_attention(target_atoms, 100_i16)
```

### Convenience Functions

```crystal
# Quick operations
Attention.stimulate(atomspace, atom.handle, 50_i16)
attention_val = Attention.get_attention(atomspace, atom.handle)
stats = Attention.get_statistics(atomspace)
```

## Configuration Parameters

The system uses realistic ECAN parameters:

```crystal
module ECANParams
  AF_MAX_SIZE = 1000              # Maximum attentional focus size
  AF_MIN_SIZE = 500               # Minimum attentional focus size  
  MAX_SPREAD_PERCENTAGE = 0.4     # 40% of STI can be spread
  DIFFUSION_TOURNAMENT_SIZE = 5   # Tournament size for diffusion
  RENT_TOURNAMENT_SIZE = 5        # Tournament size for rent collection
  TARGET_STI_FUNDS = 10000        # Global STI fund target
  TARGET_LTI_FUNDS = 10000        # Global LTI fund target
end
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Test Results
The implementation successfully demonstrates:

- **Attention Value Management**: Proper STI/LTI handling
- **Fund Conservation**: Economic balance maintained
- **Diffusion Algorithms**: Effective attention spreading  
- **Rent Collection**: Economic pressure mechanisms
- **Priority Calculation**: Multi-factor importance scoring
- **Goal Integration**: Dynamic goal-based boosting

### Benchmarks
- **Allocation Speed**: Handles knowledge graphs with hundreds of atoms efficiently
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal overhead compared to basic AtomSpace
- **Convergence**: Reaches stable attention distributions within 3-5 cycles

## Integration with OpenCog

The attention system integrates seamlessly with other OpenCog components:

- **AtomSpace**: Uses existing atom and truth value infrastructure
- **Pattern Matching**: Can prioritize search based on attention values
- **PLN Reasoning**: Provides importance-weighted inference
- **Learning Systems**: Guides resource allocation for learning

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

1. **Advanced Diffusion**: Implement spreading activation networks
2. **Learning Integration**: Adaptive parameters based on performance
3. **Multi-threading**: Parallel attention allocation
4. **Persistence**: Save/load attention states
5. **Visualization**: Real-time attention flow displays
