## The OpenCog Project ðŸ‘‹
OpenCog aims to create AGI with a combination of exploration, engineering and basic science research.
Side quests have included robotics systems ([Hanson Robotics](https://www.hansonrobotics.com)),
financial systems (Aidiya),
genomics (MOZI and Rejuve.bio),
machine learning ([predicting risk from clinician notes](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085733)),
natural language chatbots ([virtual dog playing fetch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEmpGRLwbqE)) and more.
This project was pioneered by [Dr. Ben Goertzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel).

The git repos in this project fall into four categories:

### OpenCog AtomSpace
This is the core of the system: active, stable and supported.

* Base AtomSpace
* CogServer and atomspace-cog (for networking, json, websockets)
* atomspace-rocks (disk I/O subsystem)
* Proxy Nodes (for data routing, replaces attention bank)
* Link Grammar (including the learn subproject)
* Docker containers (provide system integration)

### OpenCog Classic
Older abanondoned and obsolete components. These were educational and fun, but development has
halted. These projects are no longer maintained, but they may contain useful subsystems that
moght be slavageable for future use. This includes:
* PLN, URE, Attention, SpaceTime, Ghost, Relex, R2L, ROS, Eva/Sophia, MOSES (but not as-moses, see below).

### OpenCog Hyperon
Being developed by [Singularity.net](https://singularitynet.io)

### OpenCog Incubator
These are the immature, incomplete promising projects that haven't taken off yet.

* Atomspace-prolog proof-of-concept
* Chemistry proof-of-concept
* agi-bio
* visualization
* as-moses
* Vision proof-of-concept
* Hyperon-on-top-of-atomspace proof of concept.
* Any repo that is not marked "read-only" or "obsolete".
