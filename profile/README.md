## The OpenCog Project 👋
OpenCog aims to create AGI with a combination of exploration, engineering and basic science research.
Side qusts have included robotics systems ([Hanson Robotics](https://www.hansonrobotics.com)),
financial systems (Aidiya),
genomics (MOZI and Rejuve.bio),
machine learning ([predicting risk from clinician notes](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085733)),
natural language chatbots ([virtual dog playing fetch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEmpGRLwbqE)) and more.
This project was pioneered by [Dr. Ben Goertzel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goertzel).
