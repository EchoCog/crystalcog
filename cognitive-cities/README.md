# Cognitive Cities Architecture

## Overview

This directory implements the neurological-inspired Cognitive Cities Architecture as described in ticket OZC-70. The architecture follows a triad-based structure that mirrors biological/neurological organization, implemented as a distributed system with three main components.

## Architecture Alignment

The Cognitive Cities Architecture is aligned with the existing P-System Membrane Architecture in the EchoCog codebase:

- **Cerebral Triad** → Cognitive Membrane (Core Processing)
- **Somatic Triad** → Extension Membrane (Plugin Container)  
- **Autonomic Triad** → Security Membrane (Validation & Control)

```

## Integration with EchoCog Architecture

This implementation leverages the following components from the existing codebase:

- **Hypergraph Memory Architecture**: For sophisticated knowledge representation
- **Neural-Symbolic Integration**: Including PLN, MOSES, and ECAN components
- **P-System Membrane Rules**: For governing inter-triad service interactions
- **AtomSpace**: Central knowledge hub for cognitive processing
- **Cognitive Grammar Kernel**: Scheme-based symbolic reasoning

## Communication Patterns

The triads communicate through:

- **Event-driven architecture**: Message queues for asynchronous communication
- **RESTful APIs**: Direct service-to-service communication
- **WebSockets**: Real-time updates between triads
- **AtomSpace integration**: Shared knowledge representation

## Getting Started

Each triad directory contains its own README with specific setup and deployment instructions. Start with the cognitive-core shared libraries, then deploy the triads in the following order:

1. Autonomic Triad (foundational monitoring and state management)
2. Cerebral Triad (core cognitive processing)
3. Somatic Triad (behavioral execution)

## Development

This implementation follows the existing OpenCog development patterns and integrates with the current CI/CD workflows. All services are designed to be containerized and deployed using Kubernetes.
