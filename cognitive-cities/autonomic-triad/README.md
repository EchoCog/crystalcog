# Autonomic Triad

## Overview

The Autonomic Triad manages background processes and automated responses within the Cognitive Cities Architecture. It corresponds to the Security Membrane in the P-System Membrane Architecture and handles system validation, control, and autonomous operations.

## Color Code: Turquoise

The Autonomic Triad is represented by turquoise in the neurological metaphor, symbolizing automatic processes, system regulation, and unconscious operations.

## Services

### 1. Monitoring Service
- **Purpose**: Automatic system monitoring and health checks
- **Integration**: Connects to all system components for status monitoring
- **Input**: System metrics, health indicators, performance data
- **Output**: Alerts, status reports, diagnostic information

### 2. State Management
- **Purpose**: Maintains system state and configuration
- **Integration**: Manages AtomSpace state, service configurations
- **Input**: State changes, configuration updates, persistence requests
- **Output**: State snapshots, configuration data, recovery information

### 3. Process Director
- **Purpose**: Manages background processes and resource allocation
- **Integration**: Coordinates with Kubernetes scheduler and resource managers
- **Input**: Process requests, resource availability, priority levels
- **Output**: Process schedules, resource allocations, execution plans

### 4. Processing Service
- **Purpose**: Handles emotive and intuitive processing
- **Integration**: Implements emotional regulation and intuitive responses
- **Input**: Emotional triggers, system stress indicators, environmental changes
- **Output**: Emotional states, intuitive responses, regulatory actions

### 5. Trigger Service
- **Purpose**: Initiates automatic responses to system events
- **Integration**: Event-driven automation and emergency response
- **Input**: System events, threshold violations, external triggers
- **Output**: Automated responses, emergency actions, system adjustments

## Architecture Integration

### System Regulation
- **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and network resource allocation
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes processing load across services
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic error detection and recovery procedures

### Security and Validation
- **Input Validation**: Validates all external inputs and commands
- **Access Control**: Manages permissions and security policies
- **Threat Detection**: Monitors for security threats and anomalies

### Emotional Processing
- **Mood Regulation**: Maintains emotional equilibrium
- **Stress Response**: Handles system stress and overload conditions
- **Intuitive Processing**: Provides gut-feeling responses to situations

## Communication Patterns

### Internal Communication
- High-frequency monitoring data streams
- Event-driven trigger mechanisms
- State synchronization protocols

### External Communication
- **To Cerebral Triad**: System status, resource availability
- **To Somatic Triad**: Environmental monitoring, safety constraints
- **To External Systems**: Alerts, logs, monitoring data

## Autonomous Operations

The Autonomic Triad operates with minimal external intervention:
